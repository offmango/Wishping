TO DO / NOTES

Should current_price return Amazon's price?  Other vendor's prices don't include shipping.

Pull directly from amazon wish list?  How?  Screen-scraping?

Email me when prices change: allow user to select notification method, and what items to be notified about (plus a price to be notified if it goes under?)


Track prices, keep graphs, note when prices changed?  how much info needed?
	- added prices table

Link to full page with item info, graph of prices
